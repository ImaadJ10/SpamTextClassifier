# SpamTextClassifier

## Description
This is an end-to-end machine learning project where I build a spam text classifier using Scikit-Learn! The dataset used in this project comes from <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. This project is set up in a tutorial format so other machine learning students can learn from what I've designed here.

## Final Scores of Model
#### - <b>Accuracy:</b> 96.89%
#### - <b>Precision:</b> 100.00%
#### - <b>Recall:</b> 93.55%
#### - <b>F1 Score:</b> 96.67%
